PowerShell iteration type utilities.

## Introduction

When writing a suite of utilities/functions it can be difficult to develop them so that they behave in a consistent manner. Along with another dependent Powershell module [Elizium.Krayola](https://github.com/plastikfan/Krayola), Elizium.Loopz can be used to build PowerShell commands that are both more visually appealing and consistent particularly with regards to rendering repetitive content as a result of some kind of iteration process.

The module can be installed using the standard **install-module** command:

> PS> install-module -Name Elizium.Loopz

### Dependencies

Requires [Elizium.Krayola](https://github.com/plastikfan/Krayola) which will be installed automatically if not already present.

## The Main Commands

The following table shows the list of public commands exported from the Loopz module:

## General Concepts

### :o: PassThru hash-table object

A common theme present in the main commands is the use of a Hash-table object called $PassThru.
The scenarios in which the PassThru are as follows:

* Allows calling code to send additional parameters to a Loopz command outside of its regular signature.
* Allows invoked code to return information back to calling code.

Let's elaborate the above points...

:star: First point: [Invoke-ForeachFsItem](Elizium.Loopz/docs/Invoke-ForeachFsItem.md) requires calling code to either specify a script-block or a function (collectively called the invokee). The invokee must have to conform to a signature accepting the following four common arguments:

* Underscore: the current pipeline item
* Index: an allocated numeric value indicating the sequence number in the pipeline
* PassThru: the hash-table containing additional named items, and other information gathered throughout processing
* Trigger: client controlled boolean flag that should be used to denote if update/write action was taken for a particular item in pipeline. (Relevant for state changing operations only).

When additional parameters need to be sent to the invokee, there is already a mechanism for
passing these (either with *BlockParams* or *FuncteeParams*), this approach is generally preferred.

However, there is another commonly occurring pattern which would require the use of PassThru. This pattern is the adapter pattern. If there is an existing function that needs to be integrated to be used with Invoke-ForeachFsItem, but does not match the required signature, an intermediate adapter can be implemented. Calling code can put in any additional parameters (required by the non-conformant function) into the PassThru, which are picked up by the adapter and forwarded on as required. Using the adapter this way is much preferred than using additional parameters (*BlockParams* or *FuncteeParams*), because there could be confusion as to whom these parameters are required for, the adapter or the target function/script-block. Using parameters in PassThru can be made to be much clearer because very meaningful names can be used as hash-table keys; Eg, for internal Loopz command interaction (Invoke-MirrorDirectoryTree internally invokes Invoke-TraverseDirectory and uses keys like 'LOOPZ.MIRROR.INVOKEE', which means that, that value is only of importance to Invoke-TraverseDirectory, so any other function that sees this should ignore it).

:exclamation: Note, users should use a similar namespaced style keys, for their own use, to avoid any chance of name clashes and users should not use any keys beginning with 'LOOPZ.' as these are reserved for internal Loopz operation.

:warning: Warning don't nest Invoke-ForeachFsItem calls, using the same PassThru instance. That is to say do not use a function/script-block already known to call 'Invoke-ForeachFsItem' with its own Invoke-ForeachFsItem request using the same PassThru instance. If you need to achieve this, then a new and separate PassThru instance should be created. However, recursive functions are fine, as long as it makes sense that different iterations use the same PassThru.

:star: Second point:

The *Invoke-MirrorDirectoryTree* command illustrates this well. Invoke-MirrorDirectoryTree needs to be able to present the invokee with multiple (actually, just 2) DirectoryInfo objects for each source directory encountered, one for the source directory and another for the mirrored directory. Since *Invoke-ForeachFsItem* is the command that under-pins this functionality, Invoke-MirrorDirectoryTree needs to conform to it's requirements, one of which is that a single DirectoryInfo is presented to the invokee. To get around this, it populates a new entry inside the PassThru: 'LOOPZ.MIRROR.ROOT-DESTINATION', which the invokee can now access. This same technique can be used by calling code.

### :o: The Trigger

If the script-block/function (invokee) to be invoked by [Invoke-ForeachFsItem](Elizium.Loopz/docs/Invoke-ForeachFsItem.md), [Invoke-MirrorDirectoryTree](Elizium.Loopz/docs/Invoke-MirrorDirectoryTree.md) or [Invoke-TraverseDirectory](Elizium.Loopz/docs/Invoke-TraverseDirectory.md) (the compound function) is a state changing operation (such as renaming a file or a directory), it may be useful to know if the invokee actually performed the change or not, especially when a particular command is re-run. It may be that a rerun of a command results in no actual state change and it may be useful to know this after the batch has completed. (*Please don't confuse this with WhatIf behaviour. An example of not performing an action being alluded to here, is an attempt to rename a file where the new name is the same as the existing one; this could happen in a re-run*) In this scenario, the invokee must set the Trigger accordingly. If the write action was performed, then Trigger should be set (it's just a boolean value) on the PSCustomObject that it should return. The Trigger that the invokee receives as one of the fixed parameters passed to it by the compound function, reflects if any of the previous items in the pipeline set the Trigger.

If the user needs to write functionality that needs to be able to support re-runs, where the re-run should not
produce overly verbose output, because no real action was performed for some items in the pipeline, then use
of the 'LOOPZ.WH-FOREACH-DECORATOR.IF-TRIGGERED' setting in the PassThru should be made. It should be set
to true (although in reality, just the existence of the IF-TRIGGERED key, sets this option):

```powershell
  $PassThru['LOOPZ.WH-FOREACH-DECORATOR.IF-TRIGGERED'] = $true
```

:exclamation: *This indicates that for a particular item in the pipeline, no output should be written
for that item, if the invokee has not set the Trigger to true, to indicate that action has been performed*

If a Summary script-block is supplied to the compound function, then it will see if any of the pipeline items set the Trigger.

### :o: Write-HostFeItemDecorator

When using a custom function/script-block (invokee) with one of the compound functions it is considered good form not to write to the host within the command being written (PSScriptAnalyzer warning *PSAvoidUsingWriteHost* comes to mind). This is so that the command can be composed into a pipeline without generating convoluted output (plus other reasons). However, it isn't against the law to write output and command line utilities are made much the richer and user friendly when they receive feedback for the operations being performed.

This is where Write-HostFeItemDecorator comes in. It allows the development of commands that don't write to the host, leaving this to be taken over by Write-HostFeItemDecorator.

The following shows an example of using a named function with [*Invoke-ForeachFsItem*](Elizium.Loopz/docs/Invoke-ForeachFsItem.md)

```powershell
  function Resize-Image {
    param(
      [System.IO.FileInfo]$Underscore,
      [int]$Index,
      [System.Collections.Hashtable]$PassThru,
      [boolean]$Trigger
    )

    [PSCustomObject]@{ Product = $FileInfo; }
  }

  [string]$directoryPath = './Data/fefsi';
  Get-ChildItem $directoryPath -Recurse -File -Filter "*.jpg" | Invoke-ForeachFsItem -Functee 'Resize-Image'

```

The function does not write any output to the host. However, it might be desirable to do so. Rather than include that logic into *Resize-Image*, it can be modified to populate the returned PSCustomObject that it already creates with additional properties (although this part is optional) and then making use of *Write-HostFeItemDecorator*.

This can be achieved by defining our end function in the PassThru under key 'LOOPZ.WH-FOREACH-DECORATOR.FUNCTION-NAME' and selecting *Write-HostFeItemDecorator* to be the Functee on *Invoke-ForeachFsItem*.

```powershell
  function Resize-Image {
    param(
      [System.IO.DirectoryInfo]$Underscore,
      [int]$Index,
      [System.Collections.Hashtable]$PassThru,
      [boolean]$Trigger,
    )
    ...
    $pairs = @(
      @('By', $percentage), @('Height', $height), @('Width', $width)
    );
    @{ Product = $Underscore; Pairs = $pairs; }
  }

  [Systems.Collection.Hashtable]$passThru = @{
    'LOOPZ.WH-FOREACH-DECORATOR.FUNCTION-NAME' = 'Resize-Image';
  }

  [string]$directoryPath = './Data/fefsi';
  Get-ChildItem $directoryPath -Recurse -File -Filter "*.jpg" | Invoke-ForeachFsItem -PassThru $passThru
    -Functee 'Write-HostFeItemDecorator'
```

This sets up a new calling chain, where *Invoke-ForeachFsItem* invokes the *Write-HostFeItemDecorator* function and it in turn invokes the function defined in 'LOOPZ.WH-FOREACH-DECORATOR.FUNCTION-NAME' in this case being *Resize-Image*. This technique can also be used with [*Invoke-MirrorDirectoryTree*](Elizium.Loopz/docs/Invoke-MirrorDirectoryTree.md) and [*Invoke-TraverseDirectory*](Elizium.Loopz/docs/Invoke-TraverseDirectory.md).
