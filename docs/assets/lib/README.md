This directory contains libraries from external projects. 
They are **not** under the same license as the template code, and have their individual licenses stated in comments in the files where appropriate. 
Their licenses are compatible with the template's aim as an open-source, non-commercial project.
If you are using the theme for another purpose, please review the licenses to ensure your use case qualifies.

They are included in this directory to ensure template projects can be self-contained and could be run with out connections to external dependencies or an internet connection.
